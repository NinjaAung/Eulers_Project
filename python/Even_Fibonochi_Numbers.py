Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

                                               0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


Notes:

a + b = c      1 + 2 =Â 3
b + c + d      3 + 2 = 5


Golden rato way:

phi = 1.618034

(phi^n - (1 - phi)^n)/sqrt(5)



Recustion:
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
5 + 3 = 8

fib(0): returns 0
fib(1): returns 1
fib(2): fib(2-2) + fib(2-1) = 1
fib(3): fib(3-2) + fib(3-1) = 2
fib(4): fib(4-2) + fib(4-1) = 3
fib(5): fib(5-2) + fib(5-1) = 5
